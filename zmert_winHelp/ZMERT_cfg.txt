### Other parameters (run "ZMERT -h" for default values)
#-tokref  # should the reference sentences be tokenized (NIST-style)?
#-fin     # output file for final values
#-prevIt  # previous MERT iterations from which to consider candidates (in addition to the current iteration)
#-minIt   # minimum MERT iterations before considering an early exit
#-stopIt  # number of consecutive iterations an early exit criterion must be satisfied before actually exiting
#-stopSig # value over which a weight change is "significant" (for early exit purposes)
#-save    # should MERT save intermediate config files or decoder output files? (or both? or neither?)
#-opi     # should MERT modify at most one parameter per iteration?
#-rand    # should first initial point (of first iteration) be initialized randomly?
#-decExit # return value by decoder indicating success
#-decV    # should decoder output be printed?
